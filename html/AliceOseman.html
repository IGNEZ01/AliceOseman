                <p>
                    Originally a webcomic on Tumblr and Tapas, Heartstopper has amassed an enormous online 
                    fanbase with over 124 million views to date. Alice Oseman crowd-funded a limited 
                    print-run edition, meeting her funding goal in less than two hours. Hachette Children’s 
                    Group published Heartstopper Volume One more widely in Spring 2019, followed by Volume
                    Two in July of the same year. Since then, Hachette Children’s Group have published a 
                    further two volumes and a colouring book.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The Heartstopper series has inspired an outpouring of love since it first published in 2019,
                    with one million print copies sold worldwide to date, sell-out nationwide book tours, 
                    and a live-action Netflix adaptation hitting screens on 22nd April 2022, 
                    starring Kit Connor (Rocketman, His Dark Materials) and newcomer Joe Locke as the beloved
                    Nick and Charlie, produced by See-Saw Films.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heartstopper follows two teenage boys, Nick and Charlie, as they meet at 
                    a British grammar school, quickly become friends and fall in love. 
                    Each volume navigates the ups and downs of first love, friendships, 
                    coming out, and mental health, beautifully framed by a warm cast of 
                    supporting characters.
